# Documentation Navigation Rule

## When AI Should Reference Documentation

### Always Reference First
- **Architecture decisions**: Check `/docs/adr/` before suggesting architectural changes
- **Component creation**: Reference `/docs/conventions/component-patterns.md` for structure
- **Design decisions**: Use `/docs/project/design-principles.md` for travel UX guidance

### Documentation Hierarchy
1. **ADRs take precedence** - These explain WHY decisions were made
2. **Component patterns** - These explain HOW to implement
3. **Design principles** - These explain WHAT makes good travel UX

## File Cross-References
- When suggesting components, reference: @docs/conventions/component-patterns.md
- When making architecture changes, reference: @docs/adr/
- When designing travel features, reference: @docs/project/design-principles.md
- When planning features, reference: @docs/project/roadmap.md

## AI Behavior
- Always explain which documentation informed your suggestion
- If documentation is missing for a topic, suggest creating it
- Maintain consistency with documented patterns
- Propose ADRs for new architectural decisions
