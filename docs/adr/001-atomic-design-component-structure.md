# ADR-001: Atomic Design Component Structure

## Metadata
- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2025-06-16

## Context and Problem Statement

The Wandr travel app requires a scalable and maintainable component system that can support complex travel-related UI patterns while remaining organized and developer-friendly. As we build features for AI-powered travel assistance, location-based services, and social collaboration, we need a clear component hierarchy that both human developers and AI assistants can understand and extend.

### Business Context
- Travel apps require consistent UI patterns across multiple user journeys (planning, booking, sharing)
- Social features need reusable components for user interactions and content display
- AI-powered recommendations need flexible, composable UI elements
- Multi-platform support (iOS, Android, Web) requires maintainable component architecture

### Technical Context
- React Native with Expo Router for file-based routing
- TypeScript for type safety and better AI assistance
- Growing component library that needs organization
- Need for clear component relationships and dependencies
- Future integration with Tamagui UI library

## Decision Drivers

- **Scalability**: Need to support growing feature set without architectural debt
- **Developer Experience**: Clear component discovery and understanding
- **AI Assistance**: Enable AI models to understand component relationships
- **Reusability**: Maximize component reuse across different app sections
- **Maintainability**: Easy to update and extend components
- **Design System**: Support for consistent design language
- **Travel Domain**: Support for travel-specific UI patterns

## Considered Options

### Option 1: Flat Component Structure
**Description**: Keep all components in a single folder with descriptive names

**Pros**:
- Simple to implement
- No migration needed
- Easy to find components alphabetically

**Cons**:
- Poor scalability as component count grows
- No clear component relationships
- Difficult for AI models to understand hierarchy
- Encourages monolithic component design

**Travel App Specific Considerations**:
- Travel apps have many domain-specific components (maps, bookings, reviews)
- Flat structure would become unwieldy quickly

### Option 2: Feature-Based Component Organization
**Description**: Organize components by feature (auth, travel, social, etc.)

**Pros**:
- Aligns with feature development
- Clear feature boundaries
- Easy to locate feature-specific components

**Cons**:
- Shared components become problematic
- Encourages component duplication
- Doesn't reflect UI complexity hierarchy
- Harder to create design system

**Travel App Specific Considerations**:
- Travel features often overlap (social + booking + recommendations)
- Cross-feature component sharing is essential

### Option 3: Atomic Design Methodology
**Description**: Organize components by complexity: atoms → molecules → organisms → templates

**Pros**:
- Clear component hierarchy and relationships
- Promotes component reusability and composition
- Excellent for design system development
- Easy for AI models to understand structure
- Industry-standard approach
- Supports complex travel UI patterns

**Cons**:
- Requires migration of existing components
- Some components may be ambiguous in classification

**Travel App Specific Considerations**:
- Perfect for travel domain with varying UI complexity
- Supports both simple elements (buttons) and complex features (trip planners)
- Enables consistent travel-themed design language

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: Option 3 - Atomic Design Methodology

**Rationale**: Atomic design provides the best foundation for a scalable travel app component system. It enables clear component relationships that both developers and AI assistants can understand, promotes reusability essential for travel features, and supports the complex UI patterns needed for social travel planning.

### Expected Consequences

**Positive**:
- Clear component hierarchy improves developer productivity
- Better component reusability across travel features
- AI assistants can better understand and generate appropriate components
- Supports design system development for consistent travel UI
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Better testing strategy with component isolation

**Negative/Risks**:
- Migration overhead for existing components
- Initial confusion about component classification
- **Risk mitigation**: Create clear classification guidelines and examples

**Neutral**:
- Need to establish naming conventions and folder structure
- Requires documentation for component patterns

## Implementation Notes

### Component Folder Structure
After evaluating different co-location strategies, we decided on a **consistent component folder approach**:

```
components/atoms/
├── StyledText/
│   ├── StyledText.tsx
│   ├── StyledText.test.tsx
│   └── index.ts
├── StyledButton/
│   ├── StyledButton.tsx
│   ├── StyledButton.test.tsx
│   └── index.ts
```

**Rationale**: 
- **Consistency**: New developers always expect the same structure
- **Scalability**: Works for simple atoms and complex organisms equally
- **Encapsulation**: Each component is fully self-contained
- **Team Onboarding**: No decision fatigue about file organization
- **Tool Integration**: IDEs and build tools work predictably

### Immediate Actions Required
- [x] Create atomic design folder structure
- [x] Develop component classification guidelines
- [x] Create component template and conventions documentation
- [x] Implement consistent component folder structure
- [x] Migrate existing components to new structure
- [x] Update import statements throughout app
- [x] Add TypeScript interfaces for all component levels

### Dependencies
- Component migration must be completed before major feature development
- Documentation must be ready before team onboarding

### Timeline
- **Implementation Start**: 2025-06-16
- **Structure Completion**: 2025-06-16  
- **Expected Completion**: 2025-06-30
- **Review Date**: 2025-07-15

## Validation and Success Criteria

- All existing components successfully migrated without breaking functionality
- New components follow atomic design principles
- Component discovery time reduced (measured through developer feedback)
- AI assistants can successfully create components following the structure
- Design system components align with atomic hierarchy

**Note for AI Assistants**: This decision establishes the foundation for all component creation in the Wandr app. When creating new components, always consider their atomic level and place them in the appropriate folder. Consider travel-specific patterns and user experience implications when designing component interfaces.
